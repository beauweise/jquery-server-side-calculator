# Project Name

JQuery Server Side Calculator 2.5 day Sprint

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

A big problem that I faced was figuring out where I needed to place my calculation function on server side.
I had to ask for some help to figure that out. I had had my function placed in my app.get instead of my app.post. After that everything came together really nice.

These are the steps I took to setup and test everyting along the way.
[x] Setup Html,js, and style sheet
[x] Link to html and test
[x] Setup server and install express and body parser 
[x] Setup app.get, and an app.post function on server
[x] Setup html to show necessary information from picture.
[x] Setup button listeners 
[x] Set up a function for the = listener to take in input values
[x] Set up ajax to send information from DOM to server
[x] Finish server side post function to take information and run through the calculation function
[x] Create calculation function
[x] Create appending function on in client.js to append information to DOM
[x] Place append function in get function and return response in function to append information to DOM
[x] Clean up project
